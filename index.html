    <h3 class="title">International Court of Justice</h3>

    <p class="test1"> International Court of Justice, principal judicial organ of the United Nations,
        established 1946 by chapter 14 of the UN Charter.
        It superseded the Permanent Court of International Justice (see World Court),
        and its statute for the most part repeats that of the former tribunal.
        The court consists of 15 judges chosen for nine-year terms by the General Assembly and the Security Council,
        voting independently, from a list of candidates nominated by government-appointed national groups of
        international-law experts. No two judges may be from the same country.
        Nine judges constitute a quorum, and questions are decided by a
        majority of the judges present. The permanent seat of the court is in the Peace Palace at The Hague,
        the Netherlands, but it may hold hearings elsewhere. All members of the United
        Nations are ipso facto members of the court; other states
        may adhere to the statute. If a member of the United Nations fails to comply with a
        judgment of the court, an appeal for assistance may be made to the Security Council.
        The court may render judgment in certain disputes between states, and with
        the authorization of the General Assembly, it may deliver advisory opinions
        to any organ of the United Nations and its agencies.

    <h5 class="title"> Bhutto, Benazir, 1953–2007, prime minister of Pakistan </h5>

    <p class="test2"> Daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Educated at Radcliffe and Oxford, she returned to Pakistan
        shortly before her father was overthrown by General Zia ul-Haq in 1977.
        Under detention and then in exile, she returned in 1986 to lead
        the Pakistan People's party (PPP) and to fight military rule. In Nov.,
        1988, three months after President Zia ul-Haq
        died in a plane crash, Bhutto's alliance gained a narrow majority in parliamentary elections,
        and she became prime minister, the first female leader of a Muslim nation.
        Her government, marked by continuous  intrigue and able to accomplish little, was
        dismissed by President Gulam Ishaq Khan in Aug., 1990. He accused her, her husband,
        Asif Ali Zardari, and her party of corruption.
        Zardari was held (1990–93) on various charges, although eventually acquitted,
        and the PPP lost the late 1990 elections.

    <h4 class="title">Queen</h4>

    <p id="queen">The Queen Mother was born on August 4 1900, into interesting times.
        The world she opened her eyes on was one few of us can imagine, let alone recognise.
        The British empire was at the zenith, Queen Victoria still sat on the throne, and powered flight was
        still an impossible dream.The new century would bring changes which the parents of
        the Hon Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon could scarcely have envisaged.
        A new politics was already beginning to emerge. February 1900 saw the
        first meeting, in London's Farringdon Road, of the Labour Representation Committee,
        bringing together socialists and trade unionists. They chose as their first secretary
        James Ramsay Macdonald, who had an advantage: he was rich enough not to need a salary.
        The nascent Labour party had many rivals,including the Independent Labour party and the
        hard-left Social Democratic Federation. Macdonald's little party fared modestly in the
        so-called Khaki election of October 1900, winning only two seats.
        The Conservatives, meanwhile, were swept to a majority of 134 in the
        Commons by a tide of patriotic fervour generated by the Boer war. The
        relief of Mafeking, in May 1900, sparked an extraordinary national celebration.
        *The event had little military significance, but the people wanted heroes. They
        got one in Colonel Robert Baden-Powell who, during the siege, had pressed schoolboys
        into service as messengers - or, as he preferred to call them, Boy Scouts.
        It would be three years before the Wright
        brothers would coax the world's first powered aircraft off the ground at Kitty Hawk,
        North Carolina. But in 1900 Count Ferdinand Zeppelin was on the shores of Lake Constance
        to watch his first airship take to the skies.</p>

            Sony used its presentation at Paris Games Week on Tuesday night to announce a number
            of new PlayStation 4 titles, release dates and updates on existing games.
            Perhaps the biggest announcement was from French studio Quantic Dream,
            which revealed its next project, Detroit: Become Human. Based on the famed
            tech demo released by the Heavy Rain creator four years ago, the game sees players
            taking control of an android named Kara, who is discovered to be
            capable of emotions. According to creative director David Cage, the game will
            consider the public reaction to a new era of thinking robots – tapping
            into themes of humanity and artificial intelligence also recently
            explored in movies such as Ex Machina and the TV series Humans.
            The highly anticipated space exploration experience No Man’s Sky was given
            a release date of June 2016, pleasing many of those in the crowd. Specifics
            beyond that weren’t offered, although a new trailer – voiced by Rutger Hauer
            – was released featuring some combat and a little more on the game’s vague
            ‘head to the centre of the galaxy’ narrative.</p>
